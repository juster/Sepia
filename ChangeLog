2006-05-18  Sean O'Rourke  <sorourke@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* sepia.el, Sepia.pm: improved bulk-transfer protocol.
	* Sepia.pm: override die with simple inspector/debugger.
	* Sepia.pm: $__ and @__ now contain results of the last
	  expression.
	* sepia.el, Sepia.pm: primitive support for evaluating elisp sent
	  from Perl.  Turn on comint-use-prompt-regexp because the fields
	  stuff is flaky with this.
	* sepia.el, Sepia.pm: ",cd" shortcut coordinates directory with
	  Emacs.
	* VERSION 0.61, 0.62

2006-04-14  Sean O'Rourke  <sorourke@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* generic-repl.el: replaced by comint.
	* all: removed EPL dependency.
	* VERSION 0.59

2005-07-12  Sean O'Rourke  <sorourke@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* sepia-w3m.el: fix function name so it's found.
	* Xref.pm, Sepia.pm: cleanup and numerous bugfixes.
	* Buffer.pm: new, but not ready for prime-time
	* sepia.el: delete-thing-at-point removed; misc bugfixes.
	* test.pl: disabled a bunch of location stuff.
	* VERSION 0.58

2004-09-10  Sean O'Rourke  <sorourke@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* test.pl: some real tests.
	* Sepia.pm, Xref.pm: Separate simple symbol-table searching from
	  Xref, making the former more reliable.
	* Xref.pm: More reliable detection of (class) method calls.
	* sepia.el: results are not displayed for expressions ending in
	  ';' (c.f. Octave).

2004-04-12  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* sepia.el (sepia-doc-scan-buffer): Make regular expressions a
	bit better.
	(sepia-ident-at-point): handle upper-case function and variable
	names for completion (a bit hacky...).
	(sepia-install-keys): fix keymap installation.

2004-04-11  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* Xref.pm (guess_module_file): do like Module::Info and trust
	%INC more than our Xref info.  But don't be _too_ smart about
	this -- we were picking up lots of bogus exports.
	(pp_method_named): add support for constant-named methods (cribbed
	from B::Concise).

2004-04-10  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* Xref.pm: update $VERSION to track Sepia release.

	* sepia.el (sepia-indent-or-complete): only complete on the
	second TAB.

2004-04-09  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* sepia.el (sepia-refiner): tweak refining function a bit more.
	I'm still not entirely happy with this, but it's getting better.
	Time and experimentation are required.

	* sepia-tree.el (sepia-calle[er]-tree): New file.  Use
	caller/callee information to generate tree-view using David
	Ponce's wonderful tree-widget.

	* Xref.pm (_apropos_re): Add that Emacs-style multipart-word
	completion, so e.g. D:v_d -> Devel::Xref::var_defs.  It's groovy,
	man.
	(%firstline): gone.  Just getting a line within the sub is good
	enough -- we can fix it on the Emacs side of the fence later.

2004-04-08  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* sepia-w3m.el (sepia-w3m-perldoc-this): work for functions as
	well as modules, and try to go to correct position in manpage.

	* sepia.el (sepia-eval-buffer): use 'BEGIN{ die }' to do Xrefs
	for scripts without loading them.

	* Xref.pm: Localize a bunch of things instead of stomping on
	package lexicals.  This makes the module better handle repeated
	use, for which it wasn't designed.
	
	* Xref.pm (mod_subs): Rename package_subs for consistency.
	(mod_decls): New function to generate decls for evaluation.

	* sepia.el: misc bug-fixes, and better support for redefining
	functions with sepia-eval-defun, especially preserving files and
	line numbers.
	(sepia-eval): remove newlines to make line-numbers make more
	sense to user.
	(sepia-interactive-arg): delay reading completions to speed up
	\M-. functions.
	(sepia-refiner): search both forward and backward, to adjust for
	e.g. adding comments.  Still not so good, but better.

2004-04-06  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* sepia-w3m.el: moved w3m-perldoc support here.

	* README: added description, removed disclaimer

	* sepia.el (sepia-symbol-info, sepia-doc-update): POD scanning
	and cperl hackage for eldoc support.

2004-04-05  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* Xref.pm (redefined,forget): make them take a single sub at a
	time, and pay attention to packages.
	(_apropos): use package info to narrow choices.

	* sepia.el (sepia-eval-defun,sepia-eval-buffer): new functions.

	* test.pl: satisfy the cpants Fascists.
	
	* Xref.pm (use_type): try to be smarter about when something's
	being assigned to, vs. merely used as a reference.

	* sepia.el (sepia-repl-header): keep up with generic-repl by
	doing header line, working dir.
	(sepia-complete-symbol): stupid bug with modules.
	(sepia-install-keys): new function.
	(sepia-var-assigns): assignments are more useful than defs.
	(sepia-init): start REPL by default.

	* generic-repl.el (repl-cd,repl-set-header): "new" function from
	Slime to track working dir, update header line.

2004-04-04  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* Sepia.jpg: don't ask -- just look.
	
	* sepia.el (sepia-ident-at-point): fixed bug with sigils.
	(sepia-complete-symbol): fixed bug with undefined function
	sepia-end-of-word.  
	Always use Data::Dumper.

	* any-repl.el: new file implementing REPL, basically stolen from
	Slime.

	* pscope.el: renamed to sepia.el to go with name change.

2004-04-03  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* pscope.el (pscope-set-found): remove locations with no
	file in package "main", which were causing errors before.
	(pscope-dwim): new function.  New functions
	pscope-complete-symbol and pscope-indent-or-complete for
	symbol completion.  Not well-tested, but they seem to work.
	The most annoying thing is that since the Xref db isn't
	automatically updated, it won't always know as much as you
	expect.
	(pscope-load-file): new function.

	* Xref.pm: update export lists to reflect new functions.

2004-04-02  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* Xref.pm: minor cleanup.

	* pscope.el: pass module, file, line to Perl side (where it's
	ignored for now); fix line number refinement to be a
	little less over-eager; fix pscope-callees to go to sub
	definitions instead of call sites.
	
	* README: added TODO section.
